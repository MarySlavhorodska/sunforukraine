                <p class="mb-5">
                    The Sun for Ukraine team originates from the protests near the monument of Adam Mickiewicz, because
                    it was
                    there where most of our team members have met starting to do joint business. Initially, the main
                    goal of the team was
                    information warfare, namely, to make it so that every resident of Europe and the whole world would
                    knew exactly what is
                    happening in Ukraine, that is why "Sun" looked for and implemented into reality any ways of helping
                    Ukraine. At first it
                    was quite not decisive and with some mistakes, but then with more and more persistence. After
                    several months, it became
                    clear to the team that the information war is not enough and the Ukrainian army must be helped
                    directly. Thus, "Sun"
                    together with other participants of the protest began to organize concerts, exhibitions at which
                    fundraisings were
                    organised. In general, these actions defined one of the most basic goals of the organization in the
                    direction of which
                    we are moving up now. As of today, our team has slightly increased its focus on the organization of
                    events such as:
                    master classes, exhibitions of posters and paintings, concerts, etc. and disconnected from protests.

                <p class="mb-5"> "Sun" has a majority of Ukrainians and Poles, who are also
                    present students. Therefore, very often they have to combine everything at once: <br /> both study

                    in the organization.</p>

                    Tetyana Holiuk is a Ukrainian who has been living in Krakow for several years and currently studying
                    for a
                    master's degree at the Jagiellonian University. Tetiana is a great patriot, therefore, immediately
                    after the news of
                    relatives about a full-scale invasion of Ukraine she went to the border, where she volunteered for
                    more than a month and
                    at the same time counseled refugees on such questions as: "I'm in Poland, what to do next?", "How to
                    legalize my stay?",
                    "How to get a job?" because Tetyana herself graduated from the bachelor's degree in the specialty
                    "International
                    migration". Very often, the girl could help people without a break within 36 hours. Tatyana is very
                    dedicated and
                    hardworking, so she often volunteered getting the harm to her health. After returning to Krakow, the
                    girl continued to
                    look for some pro-Ukrainian initiatives, and over the years decided to create her own.</p>
                <p class="mb-5"> Damian PolitaÅ„ski is a Pole who lives in KrakÃ³w and studies at Jagiellonian University.
                    From the beginning of Russia's
                    full-scale invasion of Ukraine Damian conducted "informational resistance" to Russian propaganda at
                    protests near the
                    monument of Adam Mickiewicz, reciting speeches and simply supporting the Ukrainians with all of his
                    might. The guy has
                    repeatedly helped many refugees in laws aspects, because he knows Polish legislation very well. So
                    when Damian found out
                    about the idea of creating of such an organization as "Sun", he decided to support the establishment
                    without
                    hesitation.
